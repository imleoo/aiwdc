# Building Your First RSS to Blog Workflow

One of the most powerful and common uses of AiWDC is automatically transforming RSS feed content into engaging blog posts. This step-by-step tutorial will guide you through creating your first RSS to blog workflow from start to finish.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have:
- **Automated RSS Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of your favorite RSS feeds
- **AI Content Transformation**: Converting raw RSS content into engaging blog posts
- **WordPress Integration**: Automatic posting to your WordPress blog
- **Quality Control**: Built-in content validation and improvement
- **Scheduling**: Optimized publishing times

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:
- **Active AiWDC Account**: With a valid subscription
- **WordPress Blog**: With admin access
- **RSS Feeds**: At least 2-3 quality RSS feeds in your niche
- **Basic Technical Knowledge**: Comfort with web interfaces

## Step 1: Plan Your Workflow

### Understanding the Flow

```
RSS Feed → Content Extraction → AI Processing → Quality Check → WordPress Publishing
```

### Key Decisions to Make

1. **Source Selection**: Which RSS feeds provide the best content?
2. **Content Strategy**: How will you transform the content?
3. **Publishing Schedule**: When and how often to post?
4. **Quality Standards**: What makes content publishable?

### Workflow Planning Template

Create a simple plan:
```yaml
workflow_plan:
  name: "Tech News to Blog"
  sources: ["TechCrunch RSS", "VentureBeat RSS"]
  target_blog: "Your WordPress Site"
  posting_frequency: "3 times per week"
  content_style: "Professional analysis with personal insights"
  quality_threshold: "8/10"
```

## Step 2: Set Up RSS Source Connectors

### Accessing the Connector Interface

1. **Log in to AiWDC Dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Connectors** → "Data Sources"
3. **Click "Add New Source"**
4. **Select "RSS Feed"** from the options

### Basic RSS Configuration

```yaml
connector_settings:
  name: "TechCrunch RSS Feed"
  feed_url: "https://techcrunch.com/feed/"
  update_frequency: "Every 30 minutes"
  max_items_per_update: 5

  content_filtering:
    include_keywords: ["AI", "startup", "technology", "funding"]
    exclude_keywords: ["press release", "sponsored"]
    min_content_length: 300

  advanced_options:
    extract_images: true
    clean_html: true
    preserve_links: true
```

### Testing Your RSS Connection

1. **Click "Test Connection"** to verify the feed is accessible
2. **Review Sample Data** to ensure content quality
3. **Adjust Filters** based on the sample data
4. **Save the Connector** when satisfied

**Pro Tip:** Set up multiple RSS connectors for diverse content sources.

## Step 3: Configure AI Processing

### Choosing Your AI Model

For RSS to blog workflows, we recommend:

- **GPT-4**: Best for analytical and technical content

- **Qwen**: Great for multilingual or high-volume content

### AI Processing Configuration

```yaml
ai_processing:
  model: "gpt-4"
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2000

  content_transformation:
    prompt_template: |

    - name: "readability_score"
      minimum: 7.0
      tool: "flesch_kincaid"

    - name: "originality_check"
      minimum_score: 0.8
      tool: "plagiarism_detector"

    - name: "spam_detection"
      maximum_score: 0.2

  human_review:
    required_if_score_below: 7.0
    review_team: "content_team"
    notification_method: "slack"
```

### Content Validation Rules

Set up validation to ensure content meets your standards:

```yaml
validation_rules:
  must_have:
    - "compelling_headline"
    - "introduction_with_hook"
    - "key_takeaways"
    - "call_to_action"

  must_not_have:
    - "duplicate_content"
    - "inaccurate_information"
    - "spammy_language"
    - "broken_links"
```

## Step 5: Configure WordPress Integration

### WordPress Connection Setup

1. **Navigate to Publishing** → "Add Destination"
2. **Select "WordPress"** from the platform options
3. **Enter Your WordPress Site Details**:
   - Site URL
   - Admin username
   - Application password

**Security Note:** Use WordPress Application Passwords, not your main password.

### WordPress Configuration

```yaml
wordpress_settings:
  site_url: "https://yourblog.com"
  username: "admin"
  application_password: "your_app_password"

  posting_options:
    post_status: "publish"  # or "draft", "pending_review"
    post_format: "standard"
    comment_status: "open"
    ping_status: "open"

  content_formatting:
    apply_wordpress_formatting: true
    add_featured_image: true
    create_excerpt: true
    optimize_for_seo: true

  category_management:
    primary_category: "Technology"
    tags_from_content: true
    create_new_categories: false
```

### SEO Optimization Settings

Configure SEO features for your WordPress posts:

```yaml
seo_optimization:
  yoast_seo:
    focus_keyphrase: "auto_generate"
    meta_description: "auto_generate"
    readability_analysis: true

  content_elements:
    heading_structure: true
    image_alt_text: true
    internal_linking: true
    meta_length_check: true
```

## Step 6: Create the Workflow

    type: "scheduled"
    schedule: "0 */6 * * *"  # Every 6 hours
    timezone: "UTC"

  steps:
    - step: "collect_rss_content"
      connector: "techcrunch_rss"
      max_items: 3

    - step: "filter_content"
      criteria:
        min_length: 300
        relevance_threshold: 0.7

    - step: "transform_with_ai"
      model: "gpt-4"
